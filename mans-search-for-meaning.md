**Meaningful Life**
 - he who has a WHY to live for can bear almost any HOW (Nietzsche)
 - man's search for MEANING (not pleasure or power) is the primary motivation in life
 - this meaning is UNIQUE and it must and can be fulfilled by him alone
 - it differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour
 - there is no GENERAL meaning of life in but rather the SPECIFIC meaning of a person's life at a given moment
 - it's not about what WE EXPECT from life, but rather what LIFE EXPECTS from us
 - the meaning is not found in talk or meditation but in right ACTION and right CONDUCT
 - it's our responsibility to find the answers to life's problems and to fulfill our tasks which life constantly sets for each person
 - these TASKS differ from man to man and from moment to moment, thus it's impossible to define the meaning of life in general terms

 SUFFERING
 - has no limits is an ineradicable part of life just like death
 - in and of itself is MEANINGLESS; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we RESPOND to it
 - is UNAVOIDABLE, but is not necessary to find meaning
 - forces beyond your control can take away EVERYTHING you possess EXCEPT one thing, your freedom to CHOOSE your ATTITUDE and how you will RESPOND to the situation
 - we are never left with nothing as long as we retain the freedom to CHOOSE how we will RESPOND
 - suffering, like gas, COMPLETELY fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little
 - difficult EXTERNAL situations are opportunities to grow INTERNALLY
 - transform tragety into triumph and turn a predicament into achievement
 - suffering CEASES to be suffering at the moment it finds a MEANING, such as the meaning of a sacrifice

SUCCESS & HAPPINESS
 - don't aim at it - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it
 - can not be PURSUED; it can only be  ENSUED
 - you CAN'T just WISH to be happy, you must have a REASON to be happy; just like you can't laugh without a reason
 - is a BY-PRODUCT of one's dedication to a CAUSE greater than oneself or of one's surrender to a PERSON other than oneself
 - PLEASURE must also be a by-product and not a goal

LOVE
 - is the ultimate and the highest goal to which a man can aspire
 - the salvation of man is through love and in love
 - love goes far beyond the physical person, it finds its deepest meaning in the spiritual being
 - whether or not the person you love is present or is even alive is not important

JUDGING OTHERS
 - no man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honestly whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same

RIGHT & WRONG
 - no one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them

REGRET
 - use it as an opportunity to change oneself for the better

MORTALITY
 - use it as an incentive to lead a more responsible life

AGING
 - no need to pity older people
 - older people don't have POSSIBILITIES in the future, but they have REALITIES in the past - the potentialities they have actualized, the MEANINGS they have fulfilled, and the VALUES they have realized
 - value of each person is based on the value they have realized over their entire lifetime, and is not congingent on their present usefulness
