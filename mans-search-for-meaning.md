## Man's Search for Meaning
-- *Viktor Frankl*


### Meaningful Life
- he who has a **why** to live for can bear almost any **how** (Nietzsche)
- man's search for **meaning** (not pleasure or power) is the primary motivation in life
- this meaning is **unique** and it must and can be fulfilled by him alone
- it differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour
- there is no **general** meaning of life in but rather the **specific** meaning of a person's life at a given moment
- it's not about what **we expect** from life, but rather what **life efxpects** from us
- the meaning is not found in talk or meditation but in right **action** and right **conduct**
- it's our responsibility to find the answers to life's problems and to fulfill our tasks which life constantly sets for each person
- these TASKS differ from man to man and from moment to moment, thus it's impossible to define the meaning of life in general terms


### Suffering
- has no limits is an ineradicable part of life just like death
- in and of itself is **meaningless**; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we **respond** to it
- is **unavoidable**, but is not necessary to find meaning
- forces beyond your control can take away **everything** you possess **except** one thing, your freedom to **choose** your **attitude** and how you will **respond** to the situation
- we are never left with nothing as long as we retain the freedom to **choose** how we will **respond**
- suffering, like gas, **completely** fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little
- difficult **external** situations are opportunities to grow **internally**
- transform tragety into triumph and turn a predicament into achievement
- suffering **ceases** to be suffering at the moment it finds a **meaning**, such as the meaning of a sacrifice


### Success & Happiness
- don't aim at it - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it
- can not be **pursued**; it can only be  **ensued**
- you **can't** just **wish** to be happy, you must have a **reason** to be happy; just like you can't laugh without a reason
- is a **by-product** of one's dedication to a **cause** greater than oneself or of one's surrender to a **person** other than oneself
- **pleasure** must also be a by-product and not a goal


### Love
- is the ultimate and the highest goal to which a man can aspire
- the salvation of man is through love and in love
- love goes far beyond the physical person, it finds its deepest meaning in the spiritual being
- whether or not the person you love is present or is even alive is not important


### Judging Others
- no man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honestly whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same


### Right & Wrong
- no one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them


### Regret
- use it as an opportunity to change oneself for the better


### Mortality
- use it as an incentive to lead a more responsible life


### Aging
- no need to pity older people
- older people don't have **possibilities** in the future, but they have **realities** in the past - the potentialities they have actualized, the **meanings** they have fulfilled, and the **values** they have realized
- value of each person is based on the value they have realized over their entire lifetime, and is not congingent on their present usefulness
