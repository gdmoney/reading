## Outliers


- **Outliers** - people who do extraordinary things
- we tend to focus only on the individuals -  their characteristics, habits, and personality traits
- in addition to their *intelligence* and *personalities*, they were beneficiaries of hidden *advantages*, special *opportunities*, and *cultural* legacies
- **Success** is *not* just a matter of individual merit
- **Achievement = (talent + preparation + effort) + (advantage + opportunity + culture)**
- we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success with a society that provides opportunities for all

- **Work Satisfaction = autonomy + challenge + connection between effort and reward**


### Legacy
