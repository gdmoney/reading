## The Joy of X
-- *Steven Strogatz*


### Numbers
- math involves both invention *and* discovery: we invent the concepts but discover their consequences
- ***`a x b = b x a`*** - Commutative Law
- ***`(a x b) x c = a x (b x c)`*** - Associative Law
- ***`a x (b + c) = ab + ac`*** - Distributive Law
- ***`p x q =/= q x p`*** - in nature, where `p` and `q` represent the momentum and position of a quantum particle
- different ways to describe a part of a whole: **fraction**, **percent**, **decimal**
- fractions always yield decimals that terminate of eventually repeat periodically
- almost all decimals are **irrational** and their digits look statistically random
- in the **base 10** number system, there is no single symbol reserved for **10**
- 10 is marked by a *position* - the tens place - instead of a *symbol*
- dots and dashes in the **Morse code** were technological forerunners of today's zeros and ones


### Relationships
- variables are what distinguishes algebra from arithmetic
- **Identity** - a kind of a formula
- ***`(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2`***
- ***`(a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd`***
- **complex numbers** - real and imaginary numbers bonded together
- ***`i^2 = -1`***
- **The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra** - the roots of any polynomial are always complex numbers
- **fractal** - an intricate shape whose inner structure repeats at finer and finer scales
- **Complex Dynamics** - a blend of chaos theory, complex analysis, and fractal geometry
- **mathematical modeling** - making simplifying assumptions when solving word problems
- ***`x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a`*** - quadratic formula is the solution to any 
- ***`ax^2 + bx + c = 0`*** - quadratic equation
- **exponential functions** and **logarithms** are inverses of each other


### Shapes
- ***`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`*** - Pythagorean theorem - implies that space is flat, as opposed to curved
- **parabolas** and **ellipses** are both cross-sections of the surface of a **cone**
- **conic sections** - curves obtained by cutting the surface of a cone with a plane: circles, ellipses, parabolas, hyperbolas
- **since wave** - horizontal or vertical excursions of something moving in a circle
- nature's most basic mechanism of pattern formation - the emergence of sinusoidal structure from a background of bland uniformity
- ***`Pi = C / D`***
- ***`A = Pir^2`***


### Change
- calculus is the mathematics of change
- **derivative** - how fast something is changing - local rate of change
- **integral** - how much it's accumulating - cumulative rate of change
- things always change slowest at the top or the bottom
- **Snell's Law** - describes how light rays bend when they pass from air into water
- when something changes *steadily*, at a constant rate, algebra works beautifully - distance equals rate times time
- **differential equations** - how interlinked variables change from moment to moment, depending on their current values
- the laws of physics are always expressed in the language of differential equations
- **three-body problem** - contains the seeds of chaos and makes its behavior unpredictable in the long run, hence it's intractable
- **vector** - a step that carries you from one place to another
- **Maxwell's** *electromagnetic wave* unified three previously unrelated phenomena: *electricity*, *magnetism*, and *light*


### Data
- **distribution** - things that seem random and unpredictable when viewed in isolation often turn out to be lawful and predictable when viewed in aggregate
- **normal distribution** - an idealized version of the bell curve
- **power-law distribution** - have heavy tails
- **conditional probability** - the probability that some event **A** happens, given the occurrence of some other event **B**


### Frontiers
- the percentage of prime numbers decreases as numbers increase
- encryption algorithms rely on the difficulty of decomposing an enormous number into its prime factors
- **group theory** - bridges the arts and sciences; it addresses something the two cultures share - an abiding fascination with symmetry
- **topology** - offshoot of geometry where two shapes are regarded as the same if you can deform one into the other continuously
- **geodesics** - like circles, are the natural generalization of straight lines
- **Cantor** proved that some infinities are bigger than others
