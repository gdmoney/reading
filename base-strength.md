## Base Strength


- **diminished returns** - any scenario where the same investment gives less and less back over time
- **progressive overload** - continual increase in stress to the body
- **stagnation** - sudden end of progression caused by end to training adaptation

### Brick walls and how to get over them
- one rep maxes should not occur more than twice per year
- wide bases make for tall peaks
- **base** - existing broad general physical traits
- **peak** - hypothetical limit with a specific threshold
- **SAID** - specific adaptation to imposed demands - you develop specifically to the way that you train
- widen the base in order to increase the peak
- **SRA** model - stress, recovery, adaptation - stress > temporary dip in performance > recovery and gains
- stress and recovery must balance in a training program for an adaptation to be realized
- training pace as a beginner will not be sustainable long term
- intermediate and advanced lifters require considerably more recovery
- body builds a tolerance to not just the *amount* of stress, but also training threshold, movement patterns, and even the rate and method of stress increase
- **DOMS** - delayed-onset muscle soreness
- change rep ranges as your body adapts
- there is no single best training method because diminished returns come for everyone
