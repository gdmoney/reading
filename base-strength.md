## Base Strength


- **diminished returns** - any scenario where the same investment gives less and less back over time
- **progressive overload** - continual increase in stress to the body
- **stagnation** - sudden end of progression caused by end to training adaptation


### Brick walls and how to get over them
- one rep maxes should not occur more than twice per year
- wide bases make for tall peaks
- **Base** - existing broad general physical traits
- **Peak** - hypothetical limit with a specific threshold
- **SAID** - Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands - you develop specifically to the way that you train
- widen the base in order to increase the peak
- **SRA** model - Stress, Recovery, Adaptation - stress > temporary dip in performance > recovery and gains
- stress and recovery must balance in a training program for an adaptation to be realized
- training pace as a beginner will not be sustainable long term
- intermediate and advanced lifters require considerably more recovery
- body builds a tolerance to not just the *amount* of stress, but also training *threshold*, *movement patterns*, and even the rate and method of *stress increase*
- **DOMS** - Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness
- change rep ranges to preempt stagnation as your body adapts
- there is no single best training method - diminished returns come for everyone
- **SRN** - Specificity, Recovery, Novelty
  - **Specificity** - relationship between the *Base* and the *Peak*
  - **Recovery** - how sustainable the workload is
  - **Novelty** - whether diminished returns have slowed progress

- any successful training method will preempt stagnation by implementing variations in training over the long term
  - **Variation** focused on base building and specialization - vary the volume and exercise selection to widen your base
  - **Variation** as a method of recovery - subtle changes to the movement or training threshold
  - **Variation** is the only answer to diminished returns

- **Linear Periodization** - volume drops as the average weight used in each session increases over time
  - dosing the right variation of Novelty, Recovery, and Specificity will lead to a new growth response
- **Block Periodization** - similar to linear periodization but emphasis is put on optimizing each block
  - Accumulation > Transmutation > Realization - three phases or blocks of the entire macrocycle

- every program needs:
  - weekly progressive overload
  - transition between phases of high volume base building and low volume specificity
  - consideration of recovery
  - planned incorporation of novel movements and training thresholds


### Wave Progressions
- **Waves** (3-week: easy/medium/hard cycle) are stacked into **Phases**, which are alternated between **Base** and **Peak** focused
- **Base phase:** broad selection of exercises, progressively overload by increasing the *number of sets*, lower intensity (65-80%)
- **Peak phase:** narrow selection of exercises, progressively overload by increasing the *weight*, higher higher intensity (80-95%)
- **Step Load** - keep the weights the same and increase the number of reps or sets
- in the *volume-oriented* phase, you have to leave reps in the tank on each and every set
- sets of 10 is a proven muscle building approach
- **RPE** - Rate of Perceived Exertion - ranking of difficulty based on the number of reps left before failure
- most of the work should be at RPE 7 to 9
- **AMRAP** - As Many Reps As Possible - keep the weight fixed and stop one rep shy of failure
- **Linear Peak:** high intentisy (85,90,95), low reps (3,2,1), deload every 4th week (5,4,3 reps), test new max after the 12-week phase
- incorporate a full deload on week 4 or reduce RPE on week 1 to allow recovery


### Weekly Splits
- **DUP** - Daily Undulating Periodization - *hypertrophy* (volume), *strength* (heavy), *power* (speed work)
- for squatting, pressing, and pulling, frequency is virtually always at 1 to 3 times per week
- squatting is one of the more bio-mechanically friendlier movements
- deadlifts are much harder to recover from
- squatting performance can boost dramatically when the recovery cost of deadlifts isn't a factor
- 2x per week programming is the most common approach
- use *heavy/light*, *volume/intensity*, or *DUP* splits
