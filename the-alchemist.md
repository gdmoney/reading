## [The Alchemist](/the-alchemist.md)
-- *Paulo Coelho*


- when you really want something, the universe conspires to help you achieve it

- the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself and that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams

- intense, unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is apparently bearable

- it's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting

- one is loved because one is loved, no reason is needed for loving

- when we love, we always strive to become better than we are, when we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too

- there is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure

- the secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times

- everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own

- remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure

- everything that happens once can never happen again, but everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time
