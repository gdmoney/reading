## Made to Stick
-- *Chip Heath and Dan Heath*


**Stick** - your ideas are understood and remembered and have a lasting impact, they change your audience's opinions or behavior

**Simple**     - finding the core of the idea; elegant; lead; compact  
**Unexpected** - get attention > surprise; hold attention > interest  
**Concrete**   - concrete images vs ambiguous/abstract; common language  
**Credible**   - believe; use vivid, compellig details; stats  
**Emotional**  - care; create empathy; appeal to self-interest and identity  
**Story**      - act; engagement; mental simulation and inspiration > action
