## The Myths of Innovation
-- *Scott Berkun*


- history is the best available tool for sorting out how things in this world tend to happen
- ***"Sufficient repetition grants mastery of anything.***
- the love of new ideas is a myth: we prefer ideas only after others have tested them
- nearly every major innovation of the 20th century took place without claims of epiphany
- professional management was born from the desire to optimize and control, not to lead waves of change
