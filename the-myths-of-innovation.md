## The Myths of Innovation
-- *Scott Berkun*


- **Innovation** is significant positive change; so if something is done regularly, it can not represent significant change
- any seemingly grand idea can be divided into an infinite series of smaller, previously known ideas
- any major innovation or insight can be seen as the final piece of a complex puzzle falling into place
- no grand innovation in history has escaped the long hours required to take an insight and work it into something useful to the world
- what matters is the ability to see a problem clearly, combined with the talent to solve it
- epiphany is largely irrelevant because it can't be controlled
- there's no greater myth worth dispelling in the history of innovation than the idea that progress happens in a straight line
- nearly every major innovation of the 20th century took place without claims of epiphany
- six-pack of human shortcomings: greed, irrationality, short-sightedness, egotism, lack of imagination

*****

- the myth of **methodology** is the belief that a playbook exists for innovation and it removes the risk from the process of finding new ideas
- **"It doesn't matter where you start, as long as you start."** -- *John Cage*
- innovation is best compared to exploration, you can't find something new if you limit your travels to places others have already found
- **Categories** of patterns for how innovations **begin**:
  - hard work in a specific direction
  - hard work with direction change
  - curiosity
  - wealth and money
  - necessity
  - combination
- **Challenges** of innovation:
  - finding an idea
  - developing a plan
  - sponsorship and funding
  - reproduction - low expenses mean the number of competitors can be large, making it hard for customers to find you
  - reaching potential customers
  - beating competitors
  - timing
  - keeping the lights on
- **"Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new."** -- *Einstein*

*****

- every new idea in history has the big, red stamp of rejection on its face
- the love of new ideas is a myth: we prefer ideas only after others have tested them
- no matter how amazing an ideas is, its imagined benefits will pale in comparison to the real, and unimagined, fear of change
- the difference between how an innovator sees her work from how it's seen by others is the most frustrating challenge innovators face
- innovative ideas are rarely rejected on their **merits**; they're rejected because of how they make people **feel**
- **Innovator's Dilemma** - as companies grow they have more to lose, so they become more risk averse and less innovative
- **Factors** that determine how quickly innovations spread:
  - **Relative advantage** - what value does this thing have compared to the old?
  - **Compatibility** - how much effort is required to transition from the current thing to the innovation?
  - **Complexity** - how much learning is required to apply the innovation?
  - **Trialability** - how easy is it to try the innovation?
  - **Observability** - how visible are the results of the innovation?

*****

- all innovations today are bound to innovations of the past
- despite the myths, innovations rarely involve someone working alone
- **"The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas."** -- *Linus Pauling*
- anything can be used for things other than its intended purpose

*****

- the history of management is rooted in factories, banks, and railroads, not in invention, creative thinking, or revolution
- professional management was born from the desire to optimize and control, not to lead waves of change
- the goal was to minimize change, optimize performance, and take control away from individuals
- management as a discipline is steeped in an old-school command and control attitude that is alive and well in the Internet age
- **execution** - to shepherd an idea down the long, arduous path from conception to realization

*****

- **Factors of innovation**:
  - **Culture** - innovations must first gain cultural acceptance by aligning with existing values
  - **Dominant design** - to gain acceptance, it must improve on the existing idea by a sufficient margin to justify the cost of switching
  - **Inheritance and tradition** - people confuse their comfort for a belief with it actually being good
  - **Politics: who benefits?** - you can predict how people in power will respond to any new idea if you first calculate its impact on them
  - **Economics** -will the costs of changing to the new thing be worth it?
  - **Short-term vs long-term thinking** - superior ideas can be rejected in favor of cheaper, shorter-term gains

*****

- successful innovation often involves paying more attention to problems than solutions
- **"If I had 20 days to solve a problem, I would take 19 days to define it."** -- *Einstein*
- **"A well-stated problem is half-solved."** -- *John Dewey*
- **"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."**  -- *Shakespeare's Hamlet*
- morality is invisible to the forces of innovation
- what you do for good reasons may be used for bad, and what is done with bad motives can lead to good
- as ridiculous as it is to accept all new ideas simply because they're new, it's equally silly to accept all traditions simply because they're traditions
- ideas new and old have their place in the future, and it's our job to put them there

*****

- history is the best available tool for sorting out how things in this world tend to happen
- perhaps the greatest myth of all is that you need to be an expert in innovation in order to change the world
- the gap from **knowing** to **doing** is enormous, and few people are willing to do the work to close that gap
- the biggest difference between the greats and us was their dedication to their craft
- **pitch** - the act of bringing an ideas to someone who has resources you need
- most people do not like change - they fear it
- pitchable idea must include a detailed proposal for converting the abstract idea into tangible and realistic plans
- **Questions** to answer before pitching an idea:
  - **what** problem does this solve?
  - **whose** problem is this? **why** is it important to them?
  - **how** will you solve the toughest challenges?
  - do you have a working prototype?
  - why are you the right person to solve this?
  - **why** should they give you money/support/time to work on this?
