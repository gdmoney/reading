## Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion


### Spirituality
- how we pay attention to the present moment largely determines the character of our experience and, therefore, the quality of our lives
- there's more to understanding the human condition than science and secular culture generally admit
- **Spirituality** - clearer understanding of the way things are and repeatedly cutting through the illusion of self
- wisdom is nothing more profound than an ability to follow one's own advice
- Buddhism isn't primarily a faith-based religion and its central teaching are entirely empirical
- asserts that spiritual life consists in overcoming the illusion of the self by paying close attention to our experience in the present moment
- we manage to avoid being happy while struggling to *become* happy
- **Mindfullness** - a state of clear, nonjudgmental, and undistracted attention to the contents of consciousness
  - a vivid awareness of whatever is appearing in one's mind or body - thoughts, sensations, moods - without grasping at the pleasant or recoiling from the unpleasant
  - a technique for achieving equanimity amid the flux, allowing us to simply be aware of the quality of experience in each moment
- principal enemy of mindfullness is our deeply conditioned habit of being distracted by thoughts
- the problem is not thoughts themselves but the state of thinking *without being fully aware that we're thinking*
- when we look at what makes life difficult, we see that we are all prisoners of our thoughts
- the goal of meditation is to have an *increasingly* healthy mind
- conventional sources of happiness are unreliable, our feelings of fulfillment do not last, and the stress of life continues
- you can glimpse something about the nature of consciousness that will liberate you from suffering in the present
- goal of spiritual practice is the capacity to be free in this moment, in the midst of whatever is happening


### The Mystery of Consciousness
- **Spiritual Life** - investigating the nature of consciousness and transforming its contents through deliberate training
- an organism is conscious if there is something that it is like to *be* that organism
- the question of how consciousness relates to the physical world remains famously unresolved
- human *minds* are the product of human brains
- every chain of explanation must end somewhere - generally with a brute fact that neglects to explain itself
- rigorous introspection - spirituality - is an indespensable part of understanding the nature of the mind
- in split-brain phenomenon, the isolated right hemisphere is independently conscious and the divided brain harbors two distinct points of view
- consciousness is divisible, and, therefore more fundamental than any apparent self
- consciousness is the substance of any experience we can have or hope for, now or in the future
- every notion of bad or good, right or wrong, desirable or undesirable, depends upon some change in the experience of conscious creatures
