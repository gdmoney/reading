## Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion


### Spirituality
- how we pay attention to the present moment largely determines the character of our experience and, therefore, the quality of our lives
- there's more to understanding the human condition than science and secular culture generally admit
- **Spirituality** - clearer understanding of the way things are and repeatedly cutting through the illusion of self
- wisdom is nothing more profound than an ability to follow one's own advice
- Buddhism isn't primarily a faith-based religion and its central teaching are entirely empirical
- asserts that spiritual life consists in overcoming the illusion of the self by paying close attention to our experience in the present moment
- we manage to avoid being happy while struggling to *become* happy
- **Mindfullness** - a state of clear, nonjudgmental, and undistracted attention to the contents of consciousness
  - a vivid awareness of whatever is appearing in one's mind or body - thoughts, sensations, moods - without grasping at the pleasant or recoiling from the unpleasant
  - a technique for achieving equanimity amid the flux, allowing us to simply be aware of the quality of experience in each moment
- principal enemy of mindfullness is our deeply conditioned habit of being distracted by thoughts
- the problem is not thoughts themselves but the state of thinking *without being fully aware that we're thinking*
- when we look at what makes life difficult, we see that we are all prisoners of our thoughts
- the goal of meditation is to have an *increasingly* healthy mind
- conventional sources of happiness are unreliable, our feelings of fulfillment do not last, and the stress of life continues
- you can glimpse something about the nature of consciousness that will liberate you from suffering in the present
- goal of **Spiritual Practice** is the capacity to be free in this moment, in the midst of whatever is happening


### The Mystery of Consciousness
- **Spiritual Life** - investigating the nature of consciousness and transforming its contents through deliberate training
- an organism is conscious if there is something that it is like to *be* that organism
- the question of how consciousness relates to the physical world remains famously unresolved
- human *minds* are the product of human brains
- every chain of explanation must end somewhere - generally with a brute fact that neglects to explain itself
- rigorous introspection - spirituality - is an indespensable part of understanding the nature of the mind
- in split-brain phenomenon, the isolated right hemisphere is independently conscious and the divided brain harbors two distinct points of view
- consciousness is divisible, and, therefore more fundamental than any apparent self
- consciousness is the substance of any experience we can have or hope for, now or in the future
- every notion of bad or good, right or wrong, desirable or undesirable, depends upon some change in the experience of conscious creatures


### The Riddle of the Self
- conventional sense of self is an illusion and spirituality largely consists in realizing this, moment to moment
- **Psychological Continuity** - maintenance of one's memories, beliefs, habits, and other mental traits
- Buddhism teaches that there is no stable self that is carried along from one moment to the next
- **Consciousness** - the context in which the objects of experience appear
- we think of *I* as the thinker of our thoughts and the experiencer of our experience
- the self that does not survive scrutiny is the *subject* of experience in each present moment
- learn to recognize thoughts as *thoughts* - as transient appearances in consciousness - and to no longer be distracted by them
- it can be helpful to manufacture a feeling of gratitude by simply contemplating all the terrible things that have *not* happened to you
- thoughts pull the levers of emotion and negative emotions in turn set the stage for patterns of thinking that keep them active and coloring one's mind
- without continually resurrecting the feeling of anger, it is impossible to stay angry for more than a few moments
- our habitual identification with thought is a primary source of human suffering
- the self is the feeling that there's an inner subject, thinking our thoughts and experiencing our experiences
- **Theory of Mind** - capacity to understand other people by ascribing mental states to them; serves as one of the foundational elements for social interaction
- there is no rider on the horse - we can experience consciousness without a conventional sense of self


### Meditation
- a human mind is a wandering mind, and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind
- enermous difference between being hostage to one's thoughts and being freely and nonjudgmentally aware of life in the present
- **Meditation** - the ability to stop suffering in many of the usual ways, if only for a few moments at a time
  - goal is to uncover a form of well-being that is inherent to the nature of our minds
- the deepest goal of spirituatlity is freedom from the illusion of the self
- being able to stand perfectly free of the feeling of self is the *start* of one's spiritual journey, not its end
- meditation doesn't entail the suppression of thoughts, but it does require that we notice thoughts as they emerge and recognize them
- break one's identification with thought and allow the continuum of experience, pleasant and unpleasant, to simply be as it is
- train yourself to repond differently to adversity by *truly* accepting unpleasant sensations and emotions as transitory appearances in consciousness


### Gurus, Death, Drugs, and Other Puzzles
- a student's moral intuitions and instincts for self-preservation can always be recast as symptoms of fear and attachment
- nothing is intrinsically boring - boredomis simply a lack of attention
- a contemplative expert is someone who can help you realize certain truths about the nature of your own mind
- the ability to meditate - to rest consciousness for a few moments prior to the arising of the next thought - can offer a profound relief from mental suffering
- what is needed to establish the mind's independence from the brain is a case in which a person has an experience without associated brain activity
- subjectively speaking, there is only consciousness and its contents; there is no inner self who is conscious
- psilocybin and LSD pose no apparent risk of addiction and are pysically well tolerated
- MDMA has remarkable therapeutic potential but is also susceptible to abuse
- no right more fundamental than the right to peacefully steward the contents of one's own consciousness
- meditation can open the mind to a similar range of conscious states as psychedelics, but far less haphazardly
- the power of psychedelics is that they often reveal, in the span of a few hours, depths of awe and understanding that can otherwise elude us for a lifetime
- there are no real boundaries between science and any other discipline that attempts to make valid claims about the world on the basis of evidence and psychological
- we should care about demanding good reasons for what one believes and being dissatisfied with bad ones
- spirituatlity requires the same commitment to intellectual honesty


### Conclusion
- most people still believe that religion provides something essential that cannot be had any other way
- spirituality remains the great hole in secularism that reasonable people strike in the presence of unreasonable faith
- altered states of consciousness are empirical facts
- to seek to live a spiritual life without deluding ourselves, we must view these experiences in universal and secular terms
- consciousness is the light by which the contours of mind and body are known and it is never improved or harmed by what it knows
- making this discovery, again and again, is the basis of spiritual life
