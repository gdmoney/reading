## The Consolations of Philosophy
-- *Alain de Botton*


### Unpopularity - *Socrates*
- rational, as opposed to hysterical, confidence when faced with disapproval
- every society has notions of what one should believe and how one should have in order to avoid suspicion and unpopularity
- we think that societal conventions must have a sound basis because they have been adhered to by many people for a long time
- we refrain from questioning the status quo because we associate what is popular with what is right
- why do we assume that the task of directing one's life could be undertaken without any sustained reflection on premises or goals?
- the established views have frequently emerged not through a process of faultless reasoning, but through centuries of intellectual muddle
- the correctness of a statement cannot be determined by whether it is held by a majority or has been believed for a long time
- a correct statement is one incapable of being rationally contradicted
- **knowledge** - understanding not only why something is true, but also why its alternatives are false
- the approval of others forms an essential part of our capacity to believe that we are right
- what should worry us is not the number of people who oppose us, but how good their reasons are for doing so
- don't concentrate on the conclusions but on the logic used to reach them
- societal life is beset with disparities between others' perceptions of us and our reality
- the validity of an idea or action is determined not by whether it is widely believed but by whether it obeys the rules of logic
- strive to listen to the dictates of logic and not just to the public opinion


### Not Having Enough Money - *Epicurus*
- **"Nothing satisfies the man who is not satisfied with a little."**
- objects mimic in a material dimension what we require in a psychological one
- we are enticed through the sly association of superfluous objects with our other, forgotten needs
- the needs which expensive goods cater to cannot be those on which our happiness depends
- happiness may be difficult to attain, but the obstacles are not primarily financial
- **Happiness acquisition list**:
  - **Friendship**
    - **"Before you eat or drink anything, consider carefully who you eat or drink with rather than what you eat or drink."**
    - true friends do not evaluate us according to worldly criteria, it is the core self they are interested in
  - **Freedom**
    - accept a simpler way of life in exchange for independence
  - **Thought**
    - **"There is nothing dreadful in life for the man who has truly comprehended that there is nothing terrible in not living."**


### Frustration - *Seneca*
- at the heart of every frustration lies a basic structure: the collision of a wish with an unyielding reality
- sources of our satisfaction lie beyond our control and the world does not conform to our desires
- attain wisdom by learning not to aggravate the world's obstinacy through our own responses
- what makes us angry are dangerously optimistic notions about what the world and other people are like
- rage is causd by a conviction that a given frustration has not been written into the contract of life
- we will cease to be so angry once we cease to be so hopeful
- we are injured most by what we do not expect, so we must expect everything
- a subject's agency is only one of the causal factors determining events in the course of his or her life
- the continuing belief that the world is fundamentally just is implied in the very complaint that there has been an injustice
- not everything which happens **to** us occurs with reference to something **about** us
- picture of a moral universe where external circumstances reflect internal qualities is flawed
- bad things probably will occur, but they are unlikely ever to be as bad as we fear
- once we look rationally at what will occur if our desires are not fulfilled, we will almost certainly find that the underlying problems are more modest than the anxieties they have bred
- it is tempting, when we are hurt, to believe that the thing which hurt us **intended** to do so
- **"What progress, you ask, have I made? I have begun to be a friend to myself."** (-- *Hecato*)
- **"All ourdoors may be bedlam, provided that there is no disturbance within."**
- wisdom lies in correctly discerning where we are free to mould reality according to our wishes and where we must accept the unalterable with tranquility
- we may be powerless to alter certain events, but we remain free to choose our attitude towards them
- **"What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears."**
