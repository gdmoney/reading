## The Consolations of Philosophy
-- *Alain de Botton*


### Unpopularity - Socrates
- rational, as opposed to hysterical, confidence when faced with disapproval
- every society has notions of what one should believe and how one should have in ordrer to avoid suspicion and unpopularity
- we think that societal conventions must have a sound basis because they have been adhered to by many people for a long time
- we refrain from questioning the status quo because we associate what is popular with what is right
- why do we assume that the task of directing one's life could be undertaken without any sustained reflection on premises or goals?
- the established views have frequently emerged not through a process of faultless reasoning, but through centries of intellectual muddle
- the correctness of a statement cannot be determined by whether it is held by a majority or has been believed for a long time
- a correct statement is one incapable of being rationally contradicted
- **knowledge** - understanding not only why something is true, but also why its alternatives are false
- the approval of others forms an essentia part of our capacity to believe that we are right
- what should worry us is not the number of people who oppose us, but how good their reasons are for doing so
- don't concentrate on the conclusions but on the logic used to reach them
- societal life is beset with disparities between others' perceptions of us and our reality
- the validity of an idea or action is determined not by whether it is widely believed or widely reviled but by whether it obeys the rules of logic
- strive to listen to the dictates of logic and not just the public opinion


### Not Having Enough Money - Epicurus
- "Nothing satisfies the man who is not satisfied with a little."
- objects mimic in a material dimension what we require in a psychological one
- we are enticed through the sly association of superfluous objects with our other, forgotten needs
- the needs which expensive good cater to cannot be those on which our happiness depends
- happiness mayh be difficult to attain, but the obstacles are not primarily financial
- **Happiness acquisition list**:
  - **Friendship**
    - "Before you eat or drink anything, consider carefully who you eat or drink with rather than what you eat or drink."
    - true friends do not evaluate us according to worldly criteria, it is the core self they are interested in
  - **Freedom**
    - accept a simpler way of life in exchange for independence
  - **Thought**
    - "There is nothing dreadful in life for the man who has truly comprehended that there is nothing terrible in not living."
