## Drive
-- *Daniel H. Pink*


### New Operating System for Motivation
- when money is used as an external reward for some activity, people lose intrinsic interest for the activity
- **Motivation 1.0 OS** - survival
- **Motivation 2.0 OS** - improve performance, increase productivity, and encourage excellence by rewarding the good and punishing the bad
- **extrinsic motivation** - "if-then" rewards, bonuses, incentive plans, forced rankings
- **Daniel Kahneman** showed that people aren't rational calculators of their economic self-interest
- **algorithmic task** - you follow a set of established instructions down a  single pathway to one conclusion
- **heuristic task** - no algorithm exist for it, you have to experiment with possibilities and devise a novel solution
- external rewards and punishments - both carrots and sticks - can work nicely for **algorithmic** tasks but can be devastating for **heuristic** ones
- **routine**, not-so-interesting jobs require direction
- **non-routine**, more interesting work depends on self-direction
- **Motivation 2.0** two main ideas:
  - **rewarding** an activity will get you more of it
  - **punishing** an activity will get you less of it
- the best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table
- rewards can transform an interesting task into a drudge and turn play into work
- **contingent** or **if-then** rewards have a negative effect because they require people to lose their autonomy
- rewards often incur the unintentional cost of undermining the person's intrinsic motivation toward the activity
- higher rewards don't lead to higher performance
- financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance
- rewards, by their very nature, narrow our focus
- **intrinsic motivation** - the drive to do something because it is interesting, challenging, and absorbing - is essential for high levels of creativity
- **if-then** rewards usually do more harm than good by neglecting the ingredients of genuine motivation: **Autonomy**, **Mastery**, and **Purpose**
- with extrinsic rewards, people will choose the quickest route there, even if it means taking the low road
- with intrinsic motivation, the wards is the activity itself
- by offering a reward, a principal signals to the agent that the task is inherently undesirable
- if-then rewards focus people on the short-term prize and crowds out long-term learning
- **Carrots and Sticks Flaws**:
  - extinguish intrinsic motivation
  - diminish performance
  - crush creativity
  - crowd out good behavior
  - encourage cheating, shortcuts, and unethical behavior
  - become addictive
  - foster short-term thinking
