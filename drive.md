## Drive
-- *Daniel H. Pink*


### Summary
When it comes to motivation, there's a gap between what science knows and what business does. Our current business operating system - which is built around external, carrot-and-stick motivators - doesn't work and often does harm. We need an adopt a new system of motivation which has three elements:
1. **Autonomy** - the desire to direct our own lives
2. **Mastery** - the urge to make progress and get better at something that matters
3. **Purpose** - the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves


### Operating Systems for Motivation
- when money is used as an external reward for some activity, people lose intrinsic interest for the activity
- **Motivation 1.0** - survival
- **Motivation 2.0** - improve performance, increase productivity, and encourage excellence by rewarding the good and punishing the bad
- **extrinsic motivation** - "if-then" rewards, bonuses, incentive plans, forced rankings
- **Daniel Kahneman** showed that people aren't rational calculators of their economic self-interest
- **algorithmic task** - you follow a set of established instructions down a  single pathway to one conclusion
- **heuristic task** - no algorithm exist for it, you have to experiment with possibilities and devise a novel solution
- external rewards and punishments - both carrots and sticks - can work nicely for **algorithmic** tasks but can be devastating for **heuristic** ones
- **routine**, not-so-interesting jobs require direction
- **non-routine**, more interesting work depends on self-direction
- **Motivation 2.0** two main ideas:
  - **rewarding** an activity will get you more of it
  - **punishing** an activity will get you less of it
- the best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table
- rewards can transform an interesting task into a drudge and turn play into work
- **contingent** or **if-then** rewards have a negative effect because they require people to lose their autonomy
- rewards often incur the unintentional cost of undermining the person's intrinsic motivation toward the activity
- higher rewards don't lead to higher performance
- financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance
- rewards, by their very nature, narrow our focus
- **intrinsic motivation** - the drive to do something because it is interesting, challenging, and absorbing - is essential for high levels of creativity
- **if-then** rewards usually do more harm than good by neglecting the ingredients of genuine motivation: **Autonomy**, **Mastery**, and **Purpose**
- with extrinsic rewards, people will choose the quickest route there, even if it means taking the low road
- with intrinsic motivation, the wards is the activity itself
- by offering a reward, a principal signals to the agent that the task is inherently undesirable
- if-then rewards focus people on the short-term prize and crowds out long-term learning
- **Carrots and Sticks Flaws**:
  - extinguish intrinsic motivation
  - diminish performance
  - crush creativity
  - crowd out good behavior
  - encourage cheating, shortcuts, and unethical behavior
  - become addictive
  - foster short-term thinking
- without a fair and adequate baseline - compensation, benefits, etc. - any kind of motivation is difficult
- for routine tasks, which aren't very interesting and don't demand much creative thinking, rewards can provide a small motivational boost without the harmful side effects
- any extrinsic reward should be **unexpected** and offered only **after** the task is complete
- holding out a prize at the beginning of a project will inevitably focus people's attention on obtaining the reward rather than on attacking the problem
- shift from **if-then** rewards to **now that** rewards, but don't let now that rewards become the expected norm
- **non-tangible rewards** - praise regarding effort and strategy vs achieving a particular outcome and positive feedback focused on specifics
- human beings have an universal, innate drive to be **autonomous**, **self-determined**, and **connected** to one another
- **Motivation 3.0** - assumes that humans also have a third drive - to learn, to create, and to better the world
- **Type I** behavior is fueled more by intrinsic desires than extrinsic ones and cares more about the inherent satisfaction of the activity itself
- it's main motivators are freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself
- it is self-directed and is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters


### Autonomy
- **ROWE** - results-only work environment
- management's paramount goal is *compliance* and its central ethic remains *control*
- management should be about creating conditions for people to do their best work
- a sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude
- **Components**:
  - **Task** - freedom to spend a portion of time on a personal or side project
  - **Time** - focus on what people get done, not how many hours or days worked
  - **Technique** - restores some measure of freedom and draws from a deeper pool of talent
  - **Team** - people working in self-organized teams are more satisfied than those working in inherited teams
- different individuals will prize different aspects of autonomy
- encouraging autonomy doesn't mean discouraging accountability, people *want* to be accountable


### Mastery
- autonomy leads to **engagement**, control leads to **compliance**
- **mastery** - the desire to get better and better at something that matters
- the most satisfying experiences in people's lives are when they are in the **flow state**
- flaw is essential to mastery but it happens in a moment while mastery unfolds over months, years, decades
- **Laws of Mastery**:
  - **Mastery is a Mindset** - **fixed** mindset vs **growth** mindset
  - **Mastery is a Pain** - **grit** - perseverance and passion for long-term goals - is the best predictor of success
  - **Mastery is an Asymptote** - mastery is impossible to realize fully, the joy is in the pursuit
- the single greatest motivator is making progress in one's work
- once we realize that the boundaries between work and play are artificial, we can take matters in hand and begin the difficult task of making life more livable


### Purpose
- autonomous people working toward mastery *and* in service of some greater objective can achieve even more
- **Realms of Organizational Life**:
  - **Goals** - **purpose** over **profit** - pursue purpose and to use profit as the catalyst rather than the objective
  - **Words** - focus on the **why** vs the **how** in order to provide context for how what they do contributes to a larger whole
  - **Policies** - give employees control over how the organization give back to the community
- **One cannot lead a life that is truly excellent without feeling that one belongs to something greater and more permanent than oneself.** -- *Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi*
- people who are very high in extrinsic goals for wealth are more likely to attain that wealth, but they're still unhappy
- high attainers are busy making money which leaves less time for things that truly count for happiness - close relationships, love, caring
- the secret to high performance isn't our biological or our reward-and-punishment drive, but our deep-seated desire to direct our own lives, to extend and expand our abilities, and to make a contribution
- the richest experiences in our lives come when we're listening to our own voice, doing something that matters, doing it well, and doing it in the service of a cause larger than ourselves


### For Parents
- we're bribing students into compliance instead of challenging them into engagement
- autonomy over how and when students do schoolwork
- promote mastery by offering engaging tasks as opposed to rote reformulation of something already covered in class
- students should understand the purpose of how assignments contributes to the larger learning enterprise
- **allowance** - offers kids a measure of autonomy by letting them decide how to spend or save their money
- **chores** - show kids that families are built on mutual obligations and that family members all need to help each other
- by linking money to completion of chores, parents turn an allowance into an "if-then" reward, which converts a moral and familial obligation into just another commercial transaction
- help kids see the big picture by asking them to answer: *Why am I studying this?* *How is it relevant to the world I live now?*
