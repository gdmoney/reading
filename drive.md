## Drive
-- *Daniel H. Pink*


### New Operating System for Motivation
- when money is used as an external reward for some activity, people lose intrinsic interest for the activity
- **Motivation 1.0 OS** - survival
- **Motivation 2.0 OS** - improve performance, increase productivity, and encourage excellence by rewarding the good and punishing the bad
- **extrinsic motivation** - "if-then" rewards, bonuses, incentive plans, forced rankings
- **Daniel Kahneman** showed that people aren't rational calculators of their economic self-interest
- **algorithmic task** - you follow a set of established instructions down a  single pathway to one conclusion
- **heuristic task** - no algorithm exist for it, you have to experiment with possibilities and devise a novel solution
- external rewards and punishments - both carrots and sticks - can work nicely for **algorithmic** tasks but can be devastating for **heuristic** ones
- **routine**, not-so-interesting jobs require direction
- **non-routine**, more interesting work depends on self-direction
- **Motivation 2.0** two main ideas:
  - **rewarding** an activity will get you more of it
  - **punishing** an activity will get you less of it
- the best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table
- rewards can transform an interesting task into a drudge and turn play into work
- **contingent** or **if-then** rewards have a negative effect because they require people to lose their autonomy
- rewards often incur the unintentional cost of undermining the person's intrinsic motivation toward the activity
- higher rewards don't lead to higher performance
- financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance
- rewards, by their very nature, narrow our focus
- **intrinsic motivation** - the drive to do something because it is interesting, challenging, and absorbing - is essential for high levels of creativity
- **if-then** rewards usually do more harm than good by neglecting the ingredients of genuine motivation: **Autonomy**, **Mastery**, and **Purpose**
- with extrinsic rewards, people will choose the quickest route there, even if it means taking the low road
- with intrinsic motivation, the wards is the activity itself
- by offering a reward, a principal signals to the agent that the task is inherently undesirable
- if-then rewards focus people on the short-term prize and crowds out long-term learning
- **Carrots and Sticks Flaws**:
  - extinguish intrinsic motivation
  - diminish performance
  - crush creativity
  - crowd out good behavior
  - encourage cheating, shortcuts, and unethical behavior
  - become addictive
  - foster short-term thinking
- without a fair and adequate baseline - compensation, benefits, etc. - any kind of motivation is difficult
- for routine tasks, which aren't very interesting and don't demand much creative thinking, rewards can provide a small motivational boost without the harmful side effects
- any extrinsic reward should be **unexpected** and offered only **after** the task is complete
- holding out a prize at the beginning of a project will inevitably focus people's attention on obtaining the reward rather than on attacking the problem
- shift from **if-then** rewards to **now that** rewards, but don't let now that rewards become the expected norm
- **non-tangible rewards** - praise regarding effort and strategy vs achieving a particular outcome and positive feedback focused on specifics
- human beings have an universal, innate drive to be **autonomous**, **self-determined**, and **connected** to one another
- **Type I** behavior is fueled more by intrinsic desires than extrinsic ones and cares more about the inherent satisfaction of the activity itself
- it's main motivators are freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself
- it is self-directed and is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters


### Autonomy
- **ROWE** - results-only work environment
- management's paramount goal is *compliance* and its central ethic remains *control*
- management should be about creating conditions for people to do their best work
- a sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude
- **Components**:
  - **Task** - freedom to spend a portion of time on a personal or side project
  - **Time** - focus on what people get done, not how many hours or days worked
  - **Technique** - restores some measure of freedom and draws from a deeper pool of talent
  - **Team** - people working in self-organized teams are more satisfied than those working in inherited teams
- different individuals will prize different aspects of autonomy
- encouraging autonomy doesn't mean discouraging accountability, people *want* to be accountable


### Mastery
