## The Obstacle is the Way
-- *Ryan Holiday*

- **setbacks** and **problems** are always expected and never permanent
- **struggle** is the one **constant** in all of our lives
- our attitude and approach are usually at fault
- great individuals and companies find a way to transform **weakness** into **strength** and turn **adversity** into **advantage**
- obstacles are opportunities to test ourselves, to try new things, and to triumph
- great times are great softeners
- 3 steps to the discipline of overcoming obstacles: **perception**, **action**, **will**


### Perception (mind)
- how we see and understand what happens around us and what we decide those events will mean
- **context** - a sense of the big picture of the world, not just what's immediately in front of us
- **framing** - an individual's unique way of looking at the world and interpreting its events
- can be a source of **strength** or a source of **weakness**
- **perspective** is everything - when you can break apart something or look at it from some new angle, it loses power over you
- what matters is not **what** the obstacles are but **how** we see them and react to them
- desperation, fear, powerlessness are functions of our perceptions
- nothing **makes** us feel this way; we **choose** to give in to such feelings
- reacting emotionally makes us lose perspective which makes bad things even worse
- see opportunity in every disaster and transform that negative situation into a lesson
- our **perceptions** are the one thing that we're in **complete control** of
- no one else can control our thoughts, our beliefs, and our reactions - therefore we are never completely powerless
- no situation is inherently **good** or **bad** - we judge them as such based on our perceptions
- when we aim high, pressure and stress inevitably come for the ride
- steady nerves and poise are more important than talent in stressful times
- getting emotional is rarely constructive in helping to improve our situation
- **real strength** lies in the ability to **control** our emotions, not in pretending they don't exist
- take your situation and pretend it's not happening to you and it's not important before deciding on the solution
- focusing exclusively on what is in our power, magnifies our power
- focus on the **what** is in front of you and ignore the why
- **Adversarial Growth** - that which doesn't kill us makes us stronger
- problems are rarely as bad as we think - they are **precisely** as bad as we **think**


### Action (body)
- act with **deliberation**, **boldness**, and **persistence**
- each obstacle we overcome makes us stronger for the next one
- be **deliberate** but always keep moving forward
- **courage**, at its most basic level, is taking **action**
- conditions will never be perfect - start now and create your own momentum
- **genius** is often just **persistence** in disguise
- working at it works; it's that simple

- Winning Mindset:
  - never in a **hurry**
  - never **worried**
  - never **desperate**
  - never **giving up**

- **persist** and **resist** - persist in your effors; resist giving into distractions and discouragements
- when you're in it for the **long haul**, temporary **setbacks** are not discouraging
- they are just **bumps** along  a long road that you intend to travel all the way down on
- doing new things invariably means obatacles; a new path is, by definition, uncleared
- it's **ok** to be discouraged but it's **not ok** to quit
- there's nothing shameful about being wrong, about changing course
- **action** and **failure** are two sides of the same coin - one doesn't come without the other
- anticipated, temporary failure hurts less than catastrophic, permanent failure
- **failure** is bad only when we fail to learn a **lesson** from it
- failure shows us the way by showing us what **isn't** the way
- follow the **process** and **not** the **prize**
- everything is a chance to do and be your best
- in any job, work hard, be honest, and help others along the way
- how we do **anything** is how we do **everything**
- focus on the **results** and not the **methods**
- think **progress**, not **perfection**
- having the advantage of strength or size can be a long-term disatvantage because the inertia of early success will make it less likely to develop good technique
- moving forward is not always the best way to **advance**
- external factors may influence the path, but not the direction: forward
- learn to press forward when everyone else sees disaster
- you never want a serious crisis go to waste
- we can't control the world around us, so even with the right perception and right action, we can still fail


### Will (heart & soul)
- our **internal power** which can never be affected by the outside world
- find **purpose** and relief in a **cause** bigger than yourself and your personal struggles
- will is the discipline of the heart and soul
- **bear** and **forbear** - acknowledge the pain but trod onward in your task
- during the hardest times, the world gets a glimpse of what's truly inside you
- the will allows us to stand undisturbed while others wilt and give in to disorder
- confident, calm, ready to work, willing and able to continue regardless of the conditions and even during the unthinkable
- **physical** and **mental** strength are connected - sound mind in a strong body
- the path of least resistance is a terrible teacher
- **premortem** - envisioning what could/will go wrong in advance, before the start
- always be prepared for a disruption and work it into the plan
- be prepared for failure and ready for success
- when the cause of our problem lies outside of our control, we are better for accepting it and moving on
- with a **long-term view**, whatever you have to accept is only a minor blip on the way to your goal
- discard your expectations, accept what happens to us - understanding that certain things (especially bad things) are outside our control, and learn to find a joy in every single thing that happens to us in life
- turn what we **must** do, into what we **get** to do
- we don't get to choose what happens to us, but we can always choose how we feel about it
- there is always some **good** - even if only barely perceptible at first - contained within the **bad**, so we might as well enjoy it
- **perseverance** is similar to **persistence** but more long term
- **determination** is invincible, it can't be stopped by anything but death
- never lower yourself to being a person you don't like
- **shared purpose** gives us strength - focus on helping others or simply providing a good example, and your own personal fears will diminish
- 'how can i make it better for others?' not 'why did this hapen to me?'
- whatever trouble you're having is not unique, special, or unfair
- be strong for others and it will make you stronger
- **death** doesn't make life pointless, but rather purposeful
- embracing the precariousness of our own existence can be empowering
- we act like we're impervious to the trials and tribulations of mortality
- reminding ourselves each day that we will die helps us be grateful for our time

- each time you navigate an obstacle, you learn something, develop strength, wisdom, perspective and become a **better version** of you
- life is a **marathon**, not a **sprint**, each battle is only one of many and you can use it to make the next one easier
- never **rattled** or **frantic**, always **deliberate**
- flip the obstacles that life throws at you by improving not just in spite of the, but **because** of them
- no longer afraid but excited, cheerful and eagerly anticipating the next round
